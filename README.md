# Home-Automation-Using-Nodemcu-and-Thingspeak
Here we use Nodemcu-12e and Thingspeak to create an application of home automation we transmit the pir data which detetcts any motion to our thingspeak server which is then graphed
# Sensor interfacing with arduino
So in this case we are using a pir sensor module which has a digital output and its output pin gies high when it detects a motion. We connect the Dout pin of pir to any digital pin of arduino which we prefer.
